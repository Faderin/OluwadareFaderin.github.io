                        First trimester: key stages
                    </h2>
                    <p> The first trimester begins on the first day of your last period and lasts until the end of week 12. This means that by the time you know for sure you're pregnant, you might already be five or six weeks pregnant! </p>
                    <p> A lot happens during these first three months. The fertilised egg rapidly divides into layers of cells and implants in the wall of your womb where it carries on growing. These layers of cells become an embryo, which is what the baby is called at this stage. </p>
                    <p> During this trimester, your baby grows faster than at any other time. By six weeks, a heartbeat can usually be heard and by the end of week 12, your baby's bones, muscles and all the organs of the body have formed. At this point, your baby looks like a tiny human being and is now called a fetus. He or she will even be practising swallowing! </p>

                    Second trimester
                    </h2>
                    <p> The second trimester of pregnancy is a time when many women will feel energised and well. You will become visibly pregnant, but you won't be so heavy that getting around is difficult. This is also a time of rapid growth and development for your baby, and you may find yourself busy with health checks and planning for the birth. 
                    What is the second trimester?
                    Trimesters are a helpful way to think about pregnancy because the changes that happen to you and your baby fall into 3 broad categories of early, middle and late pregnancy, as reflected in the first, second and third trimesters. 
                    The second trimester represents the middle part of your pregnancy, from weeks 13 to 26. For many women, one of the best things about this trimester is that nausea might begin to settle. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What happens to your body? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Your body will undergo some major changes during the second trimester. Your uterus will grow, and you may feel some discomfort or aches as uterine ligaments stretch. You will start to feel your skin stretch around your belly and your breasts, which may cause mild itching. Some women get stretch marks in these areas, which tend to fade over time. Although your baby weighs less than a kilo, your blood volume will increase to meet the demands of all the growth happening inside you, which will mean you will gain some additional weight. </p>

                        Third trimester
                    </h2>
                    <p> What Is the Third Trimester? 
                    The third trimester is the last phase of your pregnancy. It lasts from weeks 29 to 40, or months 7, 8, and 9. During this trimester, your baby grows, develops, and starts to change position to get ready for birth. 
                    Now that you've reached the third trimester, you're in the home stretch of your pregnancy. You've only got a few more weeks to go, but this part of your pregnancy can be the most challenging. 
                    New Fetal Development
                    In the third trimester, your baby keeps growing. By the end, a full-term baby usually is between 19 and 21 inches long and between 6 and 9 pounds.
                    Your baby begins to turn itself head-down to get ready for delivery. At week 36, the baby's head should begin to move into your pelvic area, also called lightening. It will stay in this down-facing position for the last 2 weeks of your pregnancy.
                    Your baby develops in other important ways in the third trimester. During this phase, it's able to:


                    Open its eyes and see 
                    Hear 
                    Suck on its thumb 
                    Cry 
                    Smile 
                    Your baby's brain continues to develop. Its lungs and kidneys mature. It gains muscle tone and about 16% body fat. The bones at the top of its skull are soft to ease delivery. Most babies have blue eyes at this stage, and they'll stay that color until a few days or weeks after they're born. It also has nails on its toes and reaching to the ends of its fingers. If it's a boy, the testes have descended into the scrotum.
                    During the third trimester, the vernix caseosa, a protective coating, covers your fetus' skin. Soft body hair called the lanugo falls out and is almost gone by the end of week 40. </p>

                    <h3> What is a vaginal delivery? </h3>
                    <p>A vaginal delivery is when a person gives birth through their vagina. Vaginal deliveries are the most common and most preferred method of delivery. This is because they are typically low-risk and carry the most benefits to the birthing person and baby. During a vaginal birth, your uterus contracts to thin and open your cervix and push your baby out through your vagina (or birth canal). Healthcare providers prefer vaginal deliveries because they're usually safest for the fetus and the birthing person. A vaginal delivery occurs most often between weeks 37 and 42 of pregnancy.</p>
                    <br />

                    <h3> How common are vaginal deliveries? </h3>
                    <p> According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were more than 2.5 million vaginal deliveries in 2020. Vaginal deliveries account for about 68% of all births in the United States and 80% of births worldwide. </p>

                    <br />
                    <h3> What are the types of vaginal delivery? </h3>
                    <p> There are different types of vaginal deliveries: spontaneous, induced and assisted. 

                     Spontaneous vaginal delivery: A vaginal delivery that happens on its own and without labor-inducing drugs.
                     Induced vaginal delivery: Drugs or other techniques initiate labor and prepare your cervix. This is also called labor induction. 
                     Assisted vaginal delivery: A vaginal birth that occurs with the help of forceps or a vacuum device to get your baby out. Both spontaneous and induced vaginal delivery can be assisted .</p>
                    <br />
                     <h3> What are the stages of a vaginal delivery? </h3>
                    <P> A vaginal delivery can be broken into three stages: labor, birth and delivering the placenta. </P>

                    <br />
                    <h3> Labor </h3>
                    <p> The first stage of labor begins with uterine contractions and ends with your cervix being 10 centimeters dilated and 100% effaced. Labor can be classified as early labor, active labor and transitional labor. </p>

                    <p> Early labor: The time when contractions begin and your cervix starts to open (dilate) and thin (efface). Your cervix may be about 5 centimeters dilated at the end of early labor.</p>
                    <p> Active labor: This stage of labor consists of strong contractions that last up to one minute each and happen about three minutes apart. Some people request an epidural during this time because contractions can be painful. Healthcare providers may also give you oxytocin (Pitocin®) to speed up labor. </p>
                    <p> Transitional labor: This is the time just before your cervix is 10 centimeters dilated. It's a short but intense time when your contractions come very quickly and last longer than one minute. This phase may make you sweat, vomit or feel shaky. It happens just before you begin to push. </p>
                    <br />
                    <h3> Birth </h3>
                    <p> The birthing stage begins when you reach 10 centimeters and ends with the birth of your baby through your vagina. In this stage of labor, you experience strong contractions and begin pushing. You may feel pressure or like you need to poop. Your healthcare provider may coach you through pushing, especially if you've had an epidural and can't feel contractions. This phase can last a few minutes or a few hours. Generally, birth is quicker if you've had a prior vaginal delivery. </p>

                    <br />
                    <h3> Delivering the placenta </h3>
                    <p> The last stage of labor is delivering the placenta (commonly called afterbirth). It begins after your baby is removed from your vagina and ends when your placenta is delivered. Your healthcare provider may ask you for a few more pushes. This stage begins a few minutes after your baby is born and lasts up to 30 minutes. </p>
                    <p> It's important to remember that labor and childbirth are different for everyone. Certain factors can play a role in your labor being longer or shorter. For example, if you get an epidural, you won't experience the same pain level as a person who doesn't get an epidural. Also, your labor may be longer if it's your first baby. Factors like the size and position of your baby and how quickly you dilate can all affect how long a vaginal delivery takes. </p>

                    <br />
                    <h3> What are the risks of having a vaginal delivery? </h3>
                    <p> Vaginal deliveries generally carry the least risk. The most common complications during a vaginal delivery are: </p>

                    <p> Failure to progress: This is when labor slows or stops and your cervix doesn't dilate. Your healthcare provider may give you oxytocin to stimulate contractions and progress labor. </p>
                    <p> Irregular fetal heart rate: This is when your baby's heart rate slows down because their head or umbilical cord is compressed. </p>
                    <p> Hemorrhage: This is excessive or life-threatening bleeding during or after birth. Sometimes a person doesn't bleed until several hours after delivery (postpartum hemorrhage). </p>
                    <p> Vaginal tears: These are tears in the tissue around your vagina and rectum that happen during childbirth. </p>
                    <p> Deep vein thrombosis: These are blood clots that develop in your legs or pelvis shortly after delivery. </p>
                    <p> Postpartum preeclampsia: This is excessively high blood pressure in a person who has just given birth. </p>
                    <br />
                    <h3> Reasons to avoid vaginal delivery </h3>
                    <p> A vaginal delivery is usually the preferred delivery method. However, certain conditions make a vaginal delivery dangerous. Your healthcare provider may recommend a C-section delivery if:

                    <p> Your baby is in a breech position. </p>
                    <p> You have placenta previa or a problem with your placenta. </p>
                    <p> You have an untreated infection or open genital lesions from herpes simplex virus. </p> 
                    <p> You have a chronic health condition. </p>
    
                    <br />
                    <h3> What are the advantages of a vaginal delivery? </h3>
                    <p> A vaginal delivery offers several benefits to both the birthing person and the fetus. </p>

                    <br />
                    <h3> The benefits of vaginal delivery for the birthing person are: </h3>

                    <p> Shorter recovery time. </p>
                    <p> Lactation begins sooner. </p> 
                    <p> Lower chance of future pregnancy complications. </p>
                    
                    <br />
                    <h3> The benefits of vaginal delivery for the fetus are: </h3>
                    <p> Lower chance of respiratory conditions. </p> 
                    <p> Improved immune system function. </p> 
                    <p> More likely to breastfeed (chest feed). </p> 
                    
                    <br />
                    <h3> Is a vaginal delivery painful? </h3>
                    <p> Yes, it can be painful. There are many options to help manage your pain during a vaginal delivery. Some people choose to get an epidural block. An epidural numbs your body from the waist down. Discuss your options for pain relief with your healthcare provider. </p>

                    <br />
                    <h3>What side effects can I expect after a vaginal delivery? </h3>
                    <p> You may have physical and emotional changes after giving birth. It's common to experience: </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li> Constipation. </li> 
                        <li> Engorged breasts. </li>
                        <li> Pain and soreness in your vagina, especially if you tore. </li>
                        <li> Mood swings. </li>
                        <li> Vaginal bleeding. </li>
                        <li> Hemorrhoids. </li>
                        <li> Headaches, hot flashes or sweating (from hormonal changes). </li>
                        <li> Cramps. </li>

                    <p> Some people experience the "baby blues," postpartum depression or postpartum anxiety. Hormonal changes may cause sadness, crying or other emotions within the first few weeks after a vaginal delivery. If you still feel sad, anxious or have mood swings several weeks or months after your baby is born, talk to your healthcare provider. </p>

                    <h3> How long does it take to hseal from vaginal delivery? </h3>
                    <p> Recovery time for a vaginal delivery varies. Generally, healing from a vaginal delivery is faster than it is for a C-section. Several factors can influence how quickly you heal. One of those is if your vagina tears and how severe that tear is. If you've torn, you may feel sore for several weeks. Going to the bathroom, sitting and standing or performing everyday tasks may be painful. It's normal to experience swelling and itching around the tear. Most people will have swelling, bruising and general soreness in their vaginal area for a week or two, regardless of vaginal tearing. Putting cold compresses or cooling sanitary pads on your vaginal area may help. </p>

                    <h3> How long do you bleed after a vaginal delivery? </h3>
                    <p> It depends on the person. Some people will bleed for less time than others. It's normal to be bleeding at your postpartum visit several weeks later. Contact your healthcare provider if your bleeding increases over time or you're still filling extra thick sanitary pads after several weeks. </p>

                    <h3> How long after vaginal delivery can you have sex? </h3>
                    <p> Most healthcare providers recommend waiting at least six weeks or until after your postpartum visit to have sex. This gives your body time to heal and allows your provider to examine your vagina to make sure it has healed. Also, consider birth control options and future pregnancies before engaging in sexual intercourse again. Just because you aren't menstruating and have just given birth doesn't mean you can't get pregnant again. </p>

                    <h3> Can you prepare for a vaginal delivery? </h3>
                    <p> You can try to prepare by creating a birth plan, but there's no way to know what will happen when the time comes. Every labor and delivery is unique. It may help to discuss your wishes with your partner, family, friends and healthcare provider. Asking questions beforehand can also help you know what to expect. </p>
