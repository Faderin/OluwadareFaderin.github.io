                        C-section Mum Initiative is a non-governmental organization that advocates the reduction of maternal and neonatal mortality rates in Nigeria. In the past three years, we have grown by 80%. We attribute the growth to our commitment to educating and providing financial and social support for mums.

                        First trimester: key stages
                    </h3>
                    <p> 
                        
                    The first trimester begins on the first day of your last period and lasts until the end of week 12. This means that by the time you know for sure you're pregnant, you might already be five or six weeks pregnant! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    A lot happens during these first three months. The fertilised egg rapidly divides into layers of cells and implants in the wall of your womb where it carries on growing. These layers of cells become an embryo, which is what the baby is called at this stage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    During this trimester, your baby grows faster than at any other time. By six weeks, a heartbeat can usually be heard and by the end of week 12, your baby's bones, muscles and all the organs of the body have formed. At this point, your baby looks like a tiny human being and is now called a fetus. He or she will even be practising swallowing!
                    </p>

                    Second trimester
                    </h3>
                    <p> 
                    The second trimester of pregnancy is a time when many women will feel energised and well. You will become visibly pregnant, but you wonâ€™t be so heavy that getting around is difficult. This is also a time of rapid growth and development for your baby, and you may find yourself busy with health checks and planning for the birth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <p> What is the second trimester?</p>
                    <p>
                    Trimesters are a helpful way to think about pregnancy because the changes that happen to you and your baby fall into 3 broad categories of early, middle and late pregnancy, as reflected in the first, second and third trimesters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The second trimester represents the middle part of your pregnancy, from weeks 13 to 26. For many women, one of the best things about this trimester is that nausea might begin to settle.
                    </p>
                    <p> What happens to your body? </p>
                    <p>
                    Your body will undergo some major changes during the second trimester. Your uterus will grow, and you may feel some discomfort or aches as uterine ligaments stretch. You will start to feel your skin stretch around your belly and your breasts, which may cause mild itching. Some women get stretch marks in these areas, which tend to fade over time. Although your baby weighs less than a kilo, your blood volume will increase to meet the demands of all the growth happening inside you, which will mean you will gain some additional weight.
