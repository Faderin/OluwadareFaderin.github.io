                        First trimester: key stages
                    </h2>
                    <p> The first trimester begins on the first day of your last period and lasts until the end of week 12. This means that by the time you know for sure you're pregnant, you might already be five or six weeks pregnant! </p>
                    <p> A lot happens during these first three months. The fertilised egg rapidly divides into layers of cells and implants in the wall of your womb where it carries on growing. These layers of cells become an embryo, which is what the baby is called at this stage. </p>
                    <p> During this trimester, your baby grows faster than at any other time. By six weeks, a heartbeat can usually be heard and by the end of week 12, your baby's bones, muscles and all the organs of the body have formed. At this point, your baby looks like a tiny human being and is now called a fetus. He or she will even be practising swallowing! </p>

                    Second trimester
                    </h2>
                    <p> The second trimester of pregnancy is a time when many women will feel energised and well. You will become visibly pregnant, but you won't be so heavy that getting around is difficult. This is also a time of rapid growth and development for your baby, and you may find yourself busy with health checks and planning for the birth. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What is the second trimester?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Trimesters are a helpful way to think about pregnancy because the changes that happen to you and your baby fall into 3 broad categories of early, middle and late pregnancy, as reflected in the first, second and third trimesters. 
                    The second trimester represents the middle part of your pregnancy, from weeks 13 to 26. For many women, one of the best things about this trimester is that nausea might begin to settle. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What happens to your body? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Your body will undergo some major changes during the second trimester. Your uterus will grow, and you may feel some discomfort or aches as uterine ligaments stretch. You will start to feel your skin stretch around your belly and your breasts, which may cause mild itching. Some women get stretch marks in these areas, which tend to fade over time. Although your baby weighs less than a kilo, your blood volume will increase to meet the demands of all the growth happening inside you, which will mean you will gain some additional weight. </p>

                        Third trimester

                    <br?
                    <p> What Is the Third Trimester? </p> 
                    <br>
                    The third trimester is the last phase of your pregnancy. It lasts from weeks 29 to 40, or months 7, 8, and 9. During this trimester, your baby grows, develops, and starts to change position to get ready for birth. 
                    Now that you've reached the third trimester, you're in the home stretch of your pregnancy. You've only got a few more weeks to go, but this part of your pregnancy can be the most challenging. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    New Fetal Development
                    In the third trimester, your baby keeps growing. By the end, a full-term baby usually is between 19 and 21 inches long and between 6 and 9 pounds.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Your baby begins to turn itself head-down to get ready for delivery. At week 36, the baby's head should begin to move into your pelvic area, also called lightening. It will stay in this down-facing position for the last 2 weeks of your pregnancy.
                    Your baby develops in other important ways in the third trimester. During this phase, it's able to:


                    Open its eyes and see 
                    Hear 
                    Suck on its thumb 
                    Cry 
                    Smile 
                    Your baby's brain continues to develop. Its lungs and kidneys mature. It gains muscle tone and about 16% body fat. The bones at the top of its skull are soft to ease delivery. Most babies have blue eyes at this stage, and they'll stay that color until a few days or weeks after they're born. It also has nails on its toes and reaching to the ends of its fingers. If it's a boy, the testes have descended into the scrotum.
                    During the third trimester, the vernix caseosa, a protective coating, covers your fetus' skin. Soft body hair called the lanugo falls out and is almost gone by the end of week 40. </p>

                    <br>
                    <h3> What is a vaginal birth/delivery? </h3>
                    <p>A vaginal delivery is when a person gives birth through their vagina. Vaginal deliveries are the most common and most preferred method of delivery. This is because they are typically low-risk and carry the most benefits to the birthing person and baby. During a vaginal birth, your uterus contracts to thin and open your cervix and push your baby out through your vagina (or birth canal). Healthcare providers prefer vaginal deliveries because they're usually safest for the fetus and the birthing person. A vaginal delivery occurs most often between weeks 37 and 42 of pregnancy.</p>
                    <br />

                    <h3> How common are vaginal deliveries? </h3>
                    <p> According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were more than 2.5 million vaginal deliveries in 2020. Vaginal deliveries account for about 68% of all births in the United States and 80% of births worldwide. </p>

                    <br />
                    <h3> What are the types of vaginal delivery? </h3>
                    <p> There are different types of vaginal deliveries: spontaneous, induced and assisted. 

                     Spontaneous vaginal delivery: A vaginal delivery that happens on its own and without labor-inducing drugs.
                     Induced vaginal delivery: Drugs or other techniques initiate labor and prepare your cervix. This is also called labor induction. 
                     Assisted vaginal delivery: A vaginal birth that occurs with the help of forceps or a vacuum device to get your baby out. Both spontaneous and induced vaginal delivery can be assisted .</p>
                    <br />
                     <h3> What are the stages of a vaginal delivery? </h3>
                    <P> A vaginal delivery can be broken into three stages: labor, birth and delivering the placenta. </P>

                    <br />
                    <h3> Labor </h3>
                    <p> The first stage of labor begins with uterine contractions and ends with your cervix being 10 centimeters dilated and 100% effaced. Labor can be classified as early labor, active labor and transitional labor. </p>

                    <p> Early labor: The time when contractions begin and your cervix starts to open (dilate) and thin (efface). Your cervix may be about 5 centimeters dilated at the end of early labor.</p>
                    <p> Active labor: This stage of labor consists of strong contractions that last up to one minute each and happen about three minutes apart. Some people request an epidural during this time because contractions can be painful. Healthcare providers may also give you oxytocin (Pitocin®) to speed up labor. </p>
                    <p> Transitional labor: This is the time just before your cervix is 10 centimeters dilated. It's a short but intense time when your contractions come very quickly and last longer than one minute. This phase may make you sweat, vomit or feel shaky. It happens just before you begin to push. </p>
                    <br />
                    <h3> Birth </h3>
                    <p> The birthing stage begins when you reach 10 centimeters and ends with the birth of your baby through your vagina. In this stage of labor, you experience strong contractions and begin pushing. You may feel pressure or like you need to poop. Your healthcare provider may coach you through pushing, especially if you've had an epidural and can't feel contractions. This phase can last a few minutes or a few hours. Generally, birth is quicker if you've had a prior vaginal delivery. </p>

                    <br />
                    <h3> Delivering the placenta </h3>
                    <p> The last stage of labor is delivering the placenta (commonly called afterbirth). It begins after your baby is removed from your vagina and ends when your placenta is delivered. Your healthcare provider may ask you for a few more pushes. This stage begins a few minutes after your baby is born and lasts up to 30 minutes. </p>
                    <p> It's important to remember that labor and childbirth are different for everyone. Certain factors can play a role in your labor being longer or shorter. For example, if you get an epidural, you won't experience the same pain level as a person who doesn't get an epidural. Also, your labor may be longer if it's your first baby. Factors like the size and position of your baby and how quickly you dilate can all affect how long a vaginal delivery takes. </p>

                    <br />
                    <h3> What are the risks of having a vaginal delivery? </h3>
                    <p> Vaginal deliveries generally carry the least risk. The most common complications during a vaginal delivery are: </p>

                    <p> Failure to progress: This is when labor slows or stops and your cervix doesn't dilate. Your healthcare provider may give you oxytocin to stimulate contractions and progress labor. </p>
                    <p> Irregular fetal heart rate: This is when your baby's heart rate slows down because their head or umbilical cord is compressed. </p>
                    <p> Hemorrhage: This is excessive or life-threatening bleeding during or after birth. Sometimes a person doesn't bleed until several hours after delivery (postpartum hemorrhage). </p>
                    <p> Vaginal tears: These are tears in the tissue around your vagina and rectum that happen during childbirth. </p>
                    <p> Deep vein thrombosis: These are blood clots that develop in your legs or pelvis shortly after delivery. </p>
                    <p> Postpartum preeclampsia: This is excessively high blood pressure in a person who has just given birth. </p>
                    <br />
                    <h3> Reasons to avoid vaginal delivery </h3>
                    <p> A vaginal delivery is usually the preferred delivery method. However, certain conditions make a vaginal delivery dangerous. Your healthcare provider may recommend a C-section delivery if:

                    <p> Your baby is in a breech position. </p>
                    <p> You have placenta previa or a problem with your placenta. </p>
                    <p> You have an untreated infection or open genital lesions from herpes simplex virus. </p> 
                    <p> You have a chronic health condition. </p>
    
                    <br />
                    <h3> What are the advantages of a vaginal delivery? </h3>
                    <p> A vaginal delivery offers several benefits to both the birthing person and the fetus. </p>

                    <br />
                    <h3> The benefits of vaginal delivery for the birthing person are: </h3>

                    <p> Shorter recovery time. </p>
                    <p> Lactation begins sooner. </p> 
                    <p> Lower chance of future pregnancy complications. </p>
                    
                    <br />
                    <h3> The benefits of vaginal delivery for the fetus are: </h3>
                    <p> Lower chance of respiratory conditions. </p> 
                    <p> Improved immune system function. </p> 
                    <p> More likely to breastfeed (chest feed). </p> 
                    
                    <br />
                    <h3> Is a vaginal delivery painful? </h3>
                    <p> Yes, it can be painful. There are many options to help manage your pain during a vaginal delivery. Some people choose to get an epidural block. An epidural numbs your body from the waist down. Discuss your options for pain relief with your healthcare provider. </p>

                    <br />
                    <h3>What side effects can I expect after a vaginal delivery? </h3>
                    <p> You may have physical and emotional changes after giving birth. It's common to experience: </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li> Constipation. </li> 
                        <li> Engorged breasts. </li>
                        <li> Pain and soreness in your vagina, especially if you tore. </li>
                        <li> Mood swings. </li>
                        <li> Vaginal bleeding. </li>
                        <li> Hemorrhoids. </li>
                        <li> Headaches, hot flashes or sweating (from hormonal changes). </li>
                        <li> Cramps. </li>
                        <li> Lochia (a type of vaginal discharge). </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p> Some people experience the "baby blues," postpartum depression or postpartum anxiety. Hormonal changes may cause sadness, crying or other emotions within the first few weeks after a vaginal delivery. If you still feel sad, anxious or have mood swings several weeks or months after your baby is born, talk to your healthcare provider. </p>

                    <h3> How long does it take to heal from vaginal delivery? </h3>
                    <p> Recovery time for a vaginal delivery varies. Generally, healing from a vaginal delivery is faster than it is for a C-section. Several factors can influence how quickly you heal. One of those is if your vagina tears and how severe that tear is. If you've torn, you may feel sore for several weeks. Going to the bathroom, sitting and standing or performing everyday tasks may be painful. It's normal to experience swelling and itching around the tear. Most people will have swelling, bruising and general soreness in their vaginal area for a week or two, regardless of vaginal tearing. Putting cold compresses or cooling sanitary pads on your vaginal area may help. </p>

                    <br />
                    <h3> How long do you bleed after a vaginal delivery? </h3>
                    <p> It depends on the person. Some people will bleed for less time than others. It's normal to be bleeding at your postpartum visit several weeks later. Contact your healthcare provider if your bleeding increases over time or you're still filling extra thick sanitary pads after several weeks. </p>

                    <br />
                    <h3> How long after vaginal delivery can you have sex? </h3>
                    <p> Most healthcare providers recommend waiting at least six weeks or until after your postpartum visit to have sex. This gives your body time to heal and allows your provider to examine your vagina to make sure it has healed. Also, consider birth control options and future pregnancies before engaging in sexual intercourse again. Just because you aren't menstruating and have just given birth doesn't mean you can't get pregnant again. </p>

                    <br />
                    <h3> Can you prepare for a vaginal delivery? </h3>
                    <p> You can try to prepare by creating a birth plan, but there's no way to know what will happen when the time comes. Every labor and delivery is unique. It may help to discuss your wishes with your partner, family, friends and healthcare provider. Asking questions beforehand can also help you know what to expect. </p>

                    <br />
                    <h3> What questions should I ask my healthcare provider about a vaginal delivery? </h3>
                    <p> It's hard to know what to expect from a vaginal delivery, especially if you've never given birth. Even if you've had previous vaginal deliveries, each delivery is unique and different. </p>

                    <br />
                    <h3> Some common questions that people ask their healthcare provider about a vaginal delivery are: </h3>

                    <ul>
                    <li> What are the risks of a vaginal delivery? </li>
                    <li> How will I know when to push? </li>
                    <li> How can I reduce my risk of vaginal tearing? </li>
                    <li> How will I know labor is starting? </li>
                    <li> When should I go to the hospital? </li>
                    <li> How long will it take to recover from vaginal delivery? </li>
                    <li> Is there anything I can do to improve my chances of a normal delivery? </li>
                    </ul>

                    <br>
                    <p> What is a Cesarean section? </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Cesarean section, C-section, or Cesarean birth is the surgical delivery of a baby through a cut (incision) made in the mother's abdomen and uterus. Health care providers use it when they believe it is safer for the mother, the baby, or both.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The incision made in the skin may be:</p>
                    <br>
                    <li>Up-and-down (vertical). This incision extends from the belly button to the pubic hairline.</li>
                    <li>Across from side-to-side (horizontal). This incision extends across the pubic hairline. It is used most often, because it heals well and there is less bleeding.</li>
                    
                    <p>The type of incision used depends on the health of the mother and the fetus. The incision in the uterus may also be either vertical or horizontal.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Why might I need a C-section?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If you can't deliver vaginally, C-section allows the fetus to be delivered surgically. You may be able to plan and schedule your Cesarean. Or, you may have it done because of problems during labor.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Several conditions make a Cesarean delivery more likely. These include:</p>
                    <li>Abnormal position of the fetus during birth. The normal position for the fetus during birth is head-down, facing the mother's back. Sometimes a fetus is not in the right position. This makes delivery more difficult through the birth canal.</li>
                    <li>Problems with labor. Labor that fails to progress or does not progress the way it should.</li>
                    <li>Size of the fetus. The baby is too large for your provider to deliver vaginally.</li>
                    <li>Placenta problems. This includes placenta previa, in which the placenta blocks the cervix. (Premature detachment from the fetus is known as abruption).</li>
                    <li>Certain conditions in the mother, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or HIV infection
                    <li>Active herpes sores in the mother’s vagina or cervix</li>
                    <li>Twins or other multiples</li>
                    <li>Previous C-section</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>Your healthcare provider may have other reasons to recommend a Cesarean delivery.</p>

                    <p>How do I get ready for a C-section?</p>
                    <br>
                    <li>Your healthcare provider will explain the procedure to you and you can ask question.</li>
                    <li>You will be asked to sign a consent form that gives your permission to do the procedure. Read the form carefully and ask questions if something is unclear.</li>
                    <li>You will be asked when you last had anything to eat or drink. If your C-section is planned and requires general, spinal, or epidural anesthesia, you will be asked to not eat or drink anything for 8 hours before the procedure.</li>
                    <li>Tell your healthcare provider if you are sensitive to or are allergic to any medicine, latex, iodine, tape, or anesthesia.</li>
                    <li>Tell your healthcare provider of all medicine (prescription and over-the-counter), vitamins, herbs, and supplements that you are taking.</li>
                    <li>Tell your healthcare provider if you have a history of bleeding disorders or if you are taking any blood-thinning medicines (anticoagulants), aspirin, or other medicines that affect blood clotting. You may be told to stop these medicines before the procedure.</li>
                    <li>You may be given medicine to decrease the acid in your stomach. These also help dry the secretions in your mouth and breathing passages.</li>
                    <li>Plan to have someone stay with you after a C-section. You may have pain in the first few days and will need help with the baby.</li>
                    <li>Follow any other instructions your provider gives you to get ready.</li>

                    <h2 id="procedure-details"> Procedure Details </h2>
                    <p>Before the procedure</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>A C-section can be done in various ways, but most C-sections involve these steps:</p>
                    <br>
                    <li>At home. Your health care provider might ask you to shower at home with an antiseptic soap the night before and the morning of your C-section. Don't shave your pubic hair within 24 hours of your C-section. This can increase the risk of a surgical site infection. If your pubic hair needs to be removed, it will be trimmed by the surgical staff just before surgery.</li>
                    <li>At the hospital. Your abdomen will be cleansed. A thin tube (catheter) will likely be placed into your bladder to collect urine. An intravenous line will be placed in a vein in your hand or arm to provide fluid and drugs, including antibiotics to prevent infection.</li>
                    <li>Anesthesia. Most C-sections are done under regional anesthesia, which numbs only the lower part of your body. This allows you to be awake during the procedure. Common choices include a spinal block and an epidural block.</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>Some C-sections might require general anesthesia. With general anesthesia, you won't be awake during the birth.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>During the procedure</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>A doctor makes surgical incisions in the abdomen and the uterus to deliver the baby.</p>
                    <br>
                    <li>Abdominal incision. The doctor makes an incision in the abdominal wall. It's usually done horizontally near the pubic hairline. Or the doctor might make a vertical incision from just below the navel to just above the pubic bone.</li>
                    <li>Uterine incision. The uterine incision is then made — usually horizontally across the lower part of the uterus (low transverse incision). Other types of uterine incisions might be used depending on the baby's position within the uterus and whether there are complications, such as placenta previa or preterm delivery.</li>
                    <li>Delivery. The baby will be delivered through the incisions. The doctor clears the baby's mouth and nose of fluids, then clamps and cuts the umbilical cord. The placenta is then removed from the uterus, and the incisions are closed with sutures.</li>
                    <li>If you have regional anesthesia, you're likely to be able to hold the baby shortly after delivery.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>After the procedure</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>A C-section usually requires a hospital stay for 2 to 3 days. Your health care provider will discuss pain relief options with you.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Once the anesthesia begins to wear off, you'll be encouraged to drink fluids and walk. This helps prevent constipation and deep vein thrombosis. Your health care team will monitor your incision for signs of infection. The bladder catheter will likely be removed as soon as possible.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>You can start breastfeeding as soon as you're ready, even in the delivery room. Ask your nurse or a lactation consultant to teach you how to position yourself and support your baby so that you're comfortable. Your health care team will select medications for your post-surgical pain with breastfeeding in mind.</p>

                    <p>C-section - Benefits and Risks</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As with any type of surgery, there are benefits and risks to having a caesarean section (c-section). Here we explain more about what these are. Your healthcare professional will be able to tell you more about what these mean for you, depending on your circumstances.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Knowing the possible benefits and risks of having a c-section can help you decide how you would like to give birth. What this means for you will depend on several things, such as whether you’re having a planned or emergency c-section, your general health and your baby’s wellbeing.

                    </p>
                    <p>During your pregnancy, your midwife or doctor will talk to you about the benefits and risks of both caesarean and vaginal birth. They will help you think about your birth options by asking about your wishes, concerns and plans for future pregnancies.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>What are the benefits of a c-section?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If you have not had a c-section before, a planned c-section might reduce the risk of: </p>
                    <br>
                    <li>Pain during the birth</li>
                    <li>Injury to the vagina</li>
                    <li>Loss of bladder control</li>
                    <li>The womb, vagina, bowel or bladder pushing against the wall of the vagina (pelvic organ prolapse)</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>These may still happen but your risk is lower than if you had a vaginal birth. Your risk of bowel problems, pain during sex, depression and breastfeeding problems is the same as for after a vaginal birth. </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>Risks of having a c-section</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Having a c-section can increase some risks to you and your baby. This does not mean that these things will happen to you, but there may be a higher chance of them happening than if you had a vaginal birth. Speak to your midwife or doctor about how these risks may affect you and your baby.</p>
                    <p>Possible risks to you include: </p>
                    <br>
                    <li>urine, womb or wound infection – your doctor will offer you antibiotics before your c-section to help prevent infection</li>
                    <li>needing to stay in hospital for longer after the birth – the average hospital stay is 2 days after a vaginal birth and 4 days after a c-section</li>
                    <li>taking longer to recover from the birth</li>
                    <li>bleeding that leads to a blood transfusion </li>
                    <li>needing to have your womb removed (hysterectomy) – this is uncommon and may be more likely if you had problems with the placenta or bleeding during pregnancy</li>
                    <li>blood clots</li>
                    <li>problems in future pregnancies, such as low-lying placenta, placenta accreta and damage to the wall of the womb. </li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                   <p> Possible risks to your baby include:</p>  
                   <li>a cut to the skin caused during surgery – this is usually minor and heals quickly</li>  
                   <li>breathing problems – these might be more common if your baby is born before 39 weeks of pregnancy.
                    Most breathing problems get better after a few days but some babies need support in the neonatal unit. Call 999 if your baby is struggling to breathe or their skin turns very pale or blue.

                    <p>C-section - Recovery and Outlook</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Once the anesthesia wears off, you’ll begin to feel the pain from the incisions. You might also experience gas pains and have trouble taking deep breaths. Make sure an adult is there to help you get up from bed the first several days following C-section surgery. Most people stay in the hospital between two and three days.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>A full recovery can take between four and six weeks. Ask your healthcare provider what you can expect during recovery. Most providers recommend avoiding steps, lifting, exercise and other strenuous activities for several weeks. Ask your friends or partner for help with errands, cooking and cleaning so you can rest and recover. Your provider may put restrictions on driving until you're able to turn your body and apply pressure to the pedals with ease.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>You can expect cramping and bleeding for up to six weeks, as well as some discomfort around the incision. Taking over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain may help. Avoid sex for at least six weeks or until your healthcare provider gives you the OK.</p>
